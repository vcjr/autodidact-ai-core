## Query Generation Strategy

### Template Selection

**Per Domain, Select Templates Based On:**

1. **Domain Characteristics:**
   - Broad domain (e.g., MUSIC) → More general templates
   - Specific subdomain (e.g., MUSIC_PIANO) → Specific + general templates

2. **Skill Level Distribution:**
   - Beginner-heavy domains → More "getting started" templates
   - Advanced domains → More "optimization" templates

3. **Platform Suitability:**
   - Visual domains (ART, DESIGN) → YouTube-heavy
   - Discussion domains (PHILOSOPHY) → Reddit/Quora-heavy
   - Technical domains (CODING) → Blog-heavy

### Query Expansion

**Techniques:**

1. **Synonym Substitution:**
   - "learn" → "study", "master", "understand"
   - "beginner" → "newbie", "starter", "novice"

2. **Related Terms:**
   - MUSIC_PIANO → "piano", "keyboard", "pianoforte"
   - CODING_PYTHON → "Python", "Python programming", "Python3"

3. **Phrase Variations:**
   - "How to learn X" → "Learning X", "X tutorial", "X guide"

4. **Skill Decomposition:**
   - MUSIC_PIANO → "piano technique", "piano theory", "piano sight-reading"

### Query Prioritization

**High Priority Queries:**
1. Core "getting started" queries for each domain
2. Resource discovery queries (high ROI)
3. Queries with proven high result quality

**Medium Priority:**
4. Skill-specific queries
5. Problem-solving queries
6. Comparison queries

**Low Priority:**
7. Very specific niche queries
8. Redundant variations
9. Low-yield historical queries

---

## Crawl Scheduling

### Phased Rollout

**Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)**
- Top 50 high-demand domains
- Focus on beginner content
- All 4 platforms
- Establish baseline

**Phase 2: Expansion (Weeks 3-6)**
- Remaining 167 domains
- All skill levels
- Full template coverage
- Quality refinement

**Phase 3: Depth (Weeks 7-10)**
- Subdomain-specific content
- Advanced/niche queries
- Platform-specific deep dives
- Gap filling

**Phase 4: Maintenance (Ongoing)**
- Weekly incremental updates
- New content monitoring
- Content refresh (outdated detection)
- Quality improvements

### Domain Prioritization

**Tier 1 (Crawl First):**
High-demand, large communities:
- CODING_SOFTWARE & subdomains
- DATA_SCIENCE & subdomains
- MUSIC & subdomains
- VISUAL_ARTS & subdomains
- BUSINESS_MGMT & subdomains
- FITNESS_TRAINING & subdomains

**Tier 2 (Crawl Second):**
Medium demand, established communities:
- PHOTOGRAPHY, FILM_VIDEO
- FOREIGN_LANGUAGE & subdomains
- MATHEMATICS, PHYSICS
- COOKING_CULINARY
- MARTIAL_ARTS

**Tier 3 (Crawl Third):**
Specialized/niche domains:
- AQUARIUMS_VIVARIUMS
- SPEEDCUBING
- LOCKSMITHING
- NUMISMATICS
- etc.

### Temporal Strategy

**Time-Sensitive Content:**
- Technology domains: Prioritize content < 1 year old
- Fundamental domains: Accept older evergreen content
- Trending topics: Monitor and crawl immediately

**Update Frequency:**
- Tier 1 domains: Weekly updates
- Tier 2 domains: Bi-weekly updates
- Tier 3 domains: Monthly updates

---

## Resource Allocation

### API Quota Management

**YouTube API (10,000 units/day):**
- Search: 100 units each → ~100 searches/day
- Video details: 1 unit each → ~9,900 details/day
- **Strategy:** Batch searches, then get all video details

**Google Custom Search (100 queries/day free tier):**
- 100 blog searches per day
- **Strategy:** Rotate between domains daily, supplement with RSS

**Reddit API (60 requests/minute):**
- Effectively unlimited for our use case
- **Strategy:** Respect rate limits, no quota concerns

**Quora (No API):**
- Web scraping rate: ~30 pages/minute (safe limit)
- **Strategy:** Throttle to avoid detection

### Parallel Processing

**Concurrent Platform Crawls:**
```python
# Run all 4 platforms in parallel for each domain
async def crawl_domain(domain_id):
    async with asyncio.TaskGroup() as tg:
        youtube_task = tg.create_task(crawl_youtube(domain_id))
        reddit_task = tg.create_task(crawl_reddit(domain_id))
        quora_task = tg.create_task(crawl_quora(domain_id))
        blog_task = tg.create_task(crawl_blogs(domain_id))
    
    return combine_results(youtube_task, reddit_task, quora_task, blog_task)
```

**Domain Parallelization:**
- Process 5-10 domains concurrently
- Balance API quota across domains
- Isolate failures (one domain failure doesn't stop others)

---

## Quality Control

### Filtering Pipeline

**Stage 1: Pre-Fetch Filtering**
- URL pattern validation
- Domain blacklist check
- Duplicate URL detection

**Stage 2: Post-Fetch Filtering**
- Content length > minimum threshold
- Language detection (English for v1)
- Spam/low-quality detection

**Stage 3: Relevance Filtering**
- Keyword/semantic match to domain
- Quality score > threshold (60+)
- Author credibility check

**Stage 4: Manual Review (Sampling)**
- Random sample of 1% of content
- Review quality scores accuracy
- Refine scoring algorithm

### Deduplication

**Methods:**

1. **Exact URL Matching:**
   - Check URL before fetching
   - Normalize URLs (remove tracking params)

2. **Content Hash:**
   - Generate hash of main content
   - Detect reposts/mirrors

3. **Semantic Similarity:**
   - Compare embeddings
   - Merge near-duplicates (>95% similarity)

4. **Cross-Platform Deduplication:**
   - Same YouTube video discussed on Reddit
   - Blog post shared on Quora
   - **Strategy:** Link related content, don't duplicate
