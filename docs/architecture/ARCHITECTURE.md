1. Local Repository Setup (The Foundation) ⚙️
You'll need a stable environment and a project structure that scales.
Component
Technology
Local Setup
Project Management
git / Python
Initialize your repo, virtual environment (venv).
Containerization
Docker / docker-compose
Use containers to run the Vector DB and an open-source LLM locally.
Orchestration
LangChain / LangGraph
The main Python library to define the flow of your "bots" (agents).
Dependencies
requirements.txt
langchain, langgraph, pydantic, scrapy, playwright, transformers (for sentiment).
Secrets
.env file
Store API keys for OpenAI/Gemini/Claude (LLM), YouTube Data API, etc.

2. Infrastructure Deployment (Vector DB) 💾
For the massive data volume, you need a high-performance, containerized vector database.
Tech
Rationale
Action for Local Setup
Vector Database
Milvus or Weaviate
Use Docker: Define a service for Milvus/Weaviate in docker-compose.yml to run locally and isolate dependencies.
LLM (Local Option)
Ollama
Use Docker (Optional): Define a second service in docker-compose.yml to run a local LLM (e.g., Llama 3) for development/non-critical tasks.
Embedding Model
Sentence Transformers
Use a model like all-MiniLM-L6-v2 or a high-performance open-source model like BGE (e.g., via HuggingFace transformers library) for generating the vector embeddings.

Data Model for the Vector Database (Crucial for $100 \times 100 \times 100$ scale)
Your vector store must be able to filter by metadata efficiently to support your curriculum generation. Each vector chunk must be indexed with:
vector: The embedding of the text chunk.
text_chunk: The actual piece of scraped article/transcript.
instrument_id: (e.g., electric_guitar_10) - Primary filter for curriculum.
question_id: (e.g., q_45_eg_10) - Links chunk to the original question.
source_url: The link to the YouTube video or article.
source_type: (youtube, article, reddit_thread).
helpfulness_score: (0.0 to 1.0) - The key validation metadata from your validation bot.

3. The Agentic Data Pipeline (The Workflow) 🤖
Use LangGraph to model the complex, multi-step process as a State Graph.
A. Phase 1: Planning & Question Generation (LLM Agents)
Bot/Agent
Tool/Function
Role
Intake Agent
LLM (GPT-4/Gemini)
Deciphers the user's interests into the canonical Domain and Subdomain.
Scope Agent
LLM + Google Search API Tool
Takes the Subdomain, queries for the "Top 100 Instruments/Topics," and validates the list.
Question Agent
LLM (GPT-4/Gemini)
Iterates through the 100 Instruments and generates $\mathbf{100 \times 100 = 10,000}$ specific, solution-seeking questions.

B. Phase 2: Data Collection, Processing, and Indexing
Bot/Agent
Tool/Function
Role
Scraping Agent
Scrapy / Playwright / YouTube Data API
Executes $\mathbf{10,000 \times 100 = 1 \text{ million}}$ targeted searches to collect article text, YouTube transcripts, and comments/Reddit threads.
Validation Agent
Transformers Pipeline (Sentiment)
Critical step: Reads all scraped comments/feedback for a given source and assigns the $\mathbf{helpfulness\_score}$ (e.g., using a pre-trained BERT model for sentiment).
Embedding Agent
Embedding Model + LangChain Text Splitter
Processes all raw text: chunks the articles/transcripts, generates the vector embedding, and adds all metadata (including helpfulness_score) before passing to the Vector DB.
Storage Agent
Milvus/Weaviate Client
Writes the $\mathbf{1 \text{ million+}}$ enriched vectors to the Vector Database.


4. Custom Curriculum RAG (The Value Add) 🎓
This is a standard RAG pattern, but enhanced by the custom metadata you indexed.
User Query: "Create a learning path for Electric Guitar focusing on advanced techniques."
RAG Retrieval:
Filter: The query is filtered to only search vectors where $\mathbf{instrument\_id} = \text{'electric\_guitar'}$ AND $\mathbf{helpfulness\_score} \ge 0.8$.
Search: A vector similarity search is run on the remaining relevant, high-quality vectors.
Augmented Prompt: The top $K$ (e.g., $K=20$) most semantically relevant and highly-rated text chunks are combined with a detailed curriculum designer system prompt.
Generation: A capable LLM (e.g., GPT-4) uses this highly curated and community-validated context to generate the custom curriculum. The LLM can then cite the source URLs contained in the chunk metadata.
This architecture ensures that your final curriculum is grounded only in sources that your Validation Agent determined to be helpful, realizing your unique value proposition.
